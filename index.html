			<div class="line"></div>
			<h3 class="h3">Ten things we know to be <span class="txt-visible tag-1">true</span></h3>
			<p class="par mss">We first wrote these "10 things" when <span class="txt-visible tag-2">Google</span> was just a few years old. From time to time we revisit this list to see if it still holds <span class="txt-visible tag-1">true</span>. <span class="txt-visible tag-2">We hope it does—and you can hold us to that.</span></p>
			<span class="mssShow">
				<h3 class="h3">Focus on the user and <span class="txt-visible tag-2">all else will follow.</span></h3>
				<p class="par">Since the beginning, we’ve focused on providing the <span class="txt-visible span tag-2">best user experience possible</span>. Whether we’re designing a new <span class="txt-visible tag-2">Internet browser</span> or a new tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to anyone, <span class="txt-visible tag-2">and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting</span>. And when we build new tools and applications, <span class="txt-visible tag-1">we believe</span> they should work so well you don’t have to consider how they might have been designed differently.</p>
				<h3 class="h3">It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</h3>
				<p class="par">We do <span class="txt-visible tag-1">search</span>. With one of the world’s largest <span class="txt-visible tag-1">research</span> groups focused exclusively on solving <span class="txt-visible tag-1">search</span> problems, <span class="txt-visible tag-2">we know what we do well</span>, and how we could do it better. Through continued iteration on difficult problems, we’ve been able to <span class="txt-visible tag-1">solve complex issues</span> and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes <span class="txt-visible tag-1">finding information</span> a fast and <span class="txt-visible tag-2">seamless experience for millions of people</span>. Our dedication to improving <span class="txt-visible meaning">search</span> helps us apply what we’ve learned to <span class="txt-visible tag-2">new products, like Gmail and Google Maps</span>. Our hope is to bring the power <span class="txt-visible tag-1">of search to previously unexplored areas</span>, and to help people access and use even more of the <span class="txt-visible tag-1">ever-expanding information</span> in their lives.</p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">Fast</span> is better than slow.</h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-1">We know</span><span class="txt-visible tag-2"> your time is valuable</span>, so when you’re <span class="txt-visible tag-1">seeking an answer</span> on the web you want it right away–and we <span class="txt-visible tag-2">aim to please</span>. We may be the only people in the world who can say our goal is to have people leave our website <span class="txt-visible tag-2">as quickly as possible</span>. By shaving excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving environment, we’ve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average response time on a <span class="txt-visible tag-1">search result</span> is <span class="txt-visible tag-2">a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind</span> with each new product we release, whether it’s <span class="txt-visible tag-2">a mobile application or Google Chrome, a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web.</span> And we continue to work on making it all go <span class="txt-visible tag-2">even faster.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="txt-visible tag-1">Democracy</span> on the web works.</h3>
				<p class="par">Google <span class="txt-visible tag-1">search works</span> because it relies on the <span class="txt-visible tag-2">millions of individuals posting links on websites</span><span class="txt-visible tag-1">to help determine</span> which other sites offer content of value. <span class="txt-visible tag-1">We assess the importance</span> of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques, including our patented PageRank™ algorithm, which analyzes <span class="txt-visible tag-2">which sites have been “voted” to be the best</span><span class="txt-visible tag-1">sources of information</span> by other pages across the web. As the web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein, we are active in open source software development, <span class="txt-visible tag-1">where innovation takes place through the collective effort of many programmers.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3">You don’t need to be at your desk to need an <span class="txt-visible tag-1">answer.</span></h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">The world is increasingly mobile:</span> people want access to information wherever they are, whenever they need it. We’re pioneering new technologies and <span class="txt-visible tag-2">offering new solutions</span> for <span class="txt-visible tag-1">mobile services that help people</span> all over the globe to do any number of tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In addition, we’re hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, a free, open source mobile platform. Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world. Not only does <span class="txt-visible tag-2">Android benefit consumers,</span> who have more choice and innovative new mobile experiences, <span class="txt-visible tag-2">but it opens up revenue opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">You can make money without doing evil.</span></h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use AdWords to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that we’re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices:</span>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to find–so it’s possible that certain searches won’t lead to any ads at all.</span></p>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We don’t accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content you’ve requested. We’ve found that text ads that are relevant to the person reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted medium.</span></p>
				<p class="par"><span class="txt-visible tag-2">Advertising on Google is always clearly identified</span> as a “Sponsored Link,” so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. <span class="txt-visible tag-1">We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results</span><span class="txt-visible tag-2">and no one can buy better PageRank.</span> Our users trust our objectivity and no short-term gain could ever justify breaching that trust.</p>

These values are represented by the word LIFE: Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility, Efficiency.</p>
				<p class="par">These values apply to everyone at Bayer and are firmly integrated into our <span class="txt-visible tag-2">global performance management system for managerial employees.</span> Our value culture ensures a common identity within the <span class="txt-visible tag-2">enterprise across national boundaries, management hierarchies</span> and cultural differences.</p>
