			<h3 class="h3">Ten things we know to be <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">true</span></h3>
			<p class="par mss">We first wrote these "10 things" when <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Google</span> was just a few years old. From time to time we revisit this list to see if it still holds <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">true</span>. <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">We hope it does—and you can hold us to that. </span>New tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line.</p>
			<span class="mssShow">
				<h3 class="h3">Focus on the user and <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">all else will follow.</span></h3>
				<p class="par">Since the beginning, we’ve focused on providing the <span class="span  txt-visibletag-2">best user experience possible</span>. Whether we’re designing a new <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Internet browser</span> or a new tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to anyone, <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting</span>. And when we build new tools and applications, <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">we believe</span> they should work so well you don’t have to consider how they might have been designed differently.</p>
				<h3 class="h3">It’s best to do one thing really, really well.</h3>
				<p class="par">We do <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">search</span>. With one of the world’s largest <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">research</span> groups focused exclusively on solving <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">search</span> problems, <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">we know what we do well</span>, and how we could do it better. Through continued iteration on difficult problems, we’ve been able to <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">solve complex issues</span> and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">finding information</span> a fast and <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">seamless experience for millions of people</span>. Our dedication to improving <span class="meani txt-visibleng">search</span> helps us apply what we’ve learned to <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">new products, like Gmail and Google Maps</span>. Our hope is to bring the power <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">of search to previously unexplored areas</span>, and to help people access and use even more of the <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">ever-expanding information</span> in their lives.</p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Fast</span> is better than slow.</h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We know</span><span class="tag-2 txt-visible"> your time is valuable</span>, so when you’re <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">seeking an answer</span> on the web you want it right away–and we <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">aim to please</span>. We may be the only people in the world who can say our goal is to have people leave our website <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">as quickly as possible</span>. By shaving excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving environment, we’ve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average response time on a <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">search result</span> is <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind</span> with each new product we release, whether it’s <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">a mobile application or Google Chrome, a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web.</span> And we continue to work on making it all go <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">even faster.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">Democracy</span> on the web works.</h3>
				<p class="par">Google <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">search works</span> because it relies on the <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">millions of individuals posting links on websites</span><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">to help determine</span> which other sites offer content of value. <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We assess the importance</span> of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques, including our patented PageRank™ algorithm, which analyzes <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">which sites have been “voted” to be the best</span><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">sources of information</span> by other pages across the web. As the web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein, we are active in open source software development, <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">where innovation takes place through the collective effort of many programmers.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3">You don’t need to be at your desk to need an <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">answer.</span></h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">The world is increasingly mobile:</span> people want access to information wherever they are, whenever they need it. We’re pioneering new technologies and <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">offering new solutions</span> for <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">mobile services that help people</span> all over the globe to do any number of tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In addition, we’re hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, a free, open source mobile platform. Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world. Not only does <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Android benefit consumers,</span> who have more choice and innovative new mobile experiences, <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">but it opens up revenue opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">You can make money without doing evil.</span></h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use AdWords to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that we’re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices:</span>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to find–so it’s possible that certain searches won’t lead to any ads at all.</span></p>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We don’t accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content you’ve requested. We’ve found that text ads that are relevant to the person reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted medium.</span></p>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Advertising on Google is always clearly identified</span> as a “Sponsored Link,” so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results</span><span class="tag-2 txt-visible">and no one can buy better PageRank.</span> Our users trust our objectivity and no short-term gain could ever justify breaching that trust.</p>

			<p class="par mss">Bayer is a world-class innovation company with a 150-year history. Our scientific successes are intended <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">to help improve people’s lives.</span> At the same time, our innovations form the basis for sustainable and <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">profitable business activity and are the key to maintaining or achieving leadership positions in all of our markets.</span></p>
			<span class="mssShow">
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">Our products are helping to address some of today’s biggest challenges, including global population growth, an aging society and <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">the need to make efficient</span> – and, wherever possible, sustainable – use of natural resources.</span></p>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We are improving people’s quality of life</span> by preventing, alleviating or curing diseases.</p>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We are helping to provide</span> an adequate supply of high-quality food, feed and renewable plant-based raw materials.</p>
				<p class="par">In line with our mission “Bayer: Science For A Better Life”, <span class="tag-1 txt-visible">we aim to improve people’s quality of life.</span> For this endeavor, we focus on <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">our core competency of developing and successfully commercializing innovative products and solutions based on scientific knowledge.</span></p>
				<h3 class="h3">Entire Focus on Life Science <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">Businesses</span></h3>
				<p class="par">Bayer is charting the course for its <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">successful development</span> as a Life Science company. From January 1, 2016, <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">the company’s business</span> will be managed by three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science. The present structure of a <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">strategic management holding company and operational subgroups will be replaced by an integrated organization under the umbrella of the strong Bayer brand.</span></p>
				<p class="par">As part of the reorganization, <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">the Bayer HealthCare subgroup will be dissolved.</span> The Radiology business will be assigned to the Pharmaceuticals Division. Consumer Health will comprise the present Consumer Care Division. The Bayer CropScience subgroup will become the Crop Science Division. As a business unit, Animal Health will report directly to Liam Condon.</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Our Values</h3>
				<p class="par"><span class="tag-1 txt-visible">We are committed to operating sustainably and addressing our social and ethical responsibilities as a corporate citizen.</span> Bayer’s values play a central role in our daily work and are intended to guide us in fulfilling our mission. These values are represented by the word LIFE: Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility, Efficiency.</p>
				<p class="par">These values apply to everyone at Bayer and are firmly integrated into our <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">global performance management system for managerial employees.</span> Our value culture ensures a common identity within the <span class="tag-2 txt-visible">enterprise across national boundaries, management hierarchies</span> and cultural differences.</p>
